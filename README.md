# ðŸš¨ Crime Hotspot Prediction  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project aims to identify crime hotspots in **Los Angeles** using **machine learning** techniques and historical crime data. By analyzing factors like **location, time, and crime type**, the goal is to predict areas at high risk of criminal activity. This helps in providing targeted security measures for law enforcement agencies and businesses.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives  
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand crime patterns.  
- Develop **machine learning models** for crime prediction, including **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost**.  
- Identify key factors that contribute to the likelihood of crime occurrences.  
- Build **interactive visualizations** to represent crime severity and locations.  
- Provide actionable insights and recommendations for better resource allocation in high-risk areas.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Information  
The **Crime dataset** consists of **historical crime data** in Los Angeles, containing features such as:  
- **Location** (latitude, longitude)  
- **Time** (day, month, year)  
- **Crime Type** (e.g., burglary, assault, robbery)  
- **Victim information** (e.g., gender, age)  
- **Neighborhood & Zone information**

## ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Models  
- **Logistic Regression:** Used as a baseline model to predict crime occurrence.  
- **Random Forest:** A robust ensemble method to improve prediction accuracy.  
- **XGBoost:** A powerful gradient boosting model optimized for performance.  

### ðŸ“Š Model Evaluation Metrics:  
- **Accuracy:** Measures overall prediction correctness.  
- **Precision & Recall:** Evaluates model's performance on class imbalance.  
- **AUC-ROC Curve:** Measures modelâ€™s ability to distinguish between crime and non-crime areas.

## ðŸ“Š Crime Data Visualization  
ðŸ“Œ **Key Insights Visualized:**  
- **Heatmaps of Crime Density** in various neighborhoods.  
- **Crime Trends Over Time** (monthly/seasonal patterns).  
- **Crime Distribution by Type** (burglary, robbery, assault).  
- **Crime Severity by Area** (high-risk vs low-risk zones).

---

## ðŸ“‘ Results & Key Findings  
- High crime rates were concentrated in certain **high-density urban zones**.  
- **Time of day** (e.g., nighttime) and **weekends** showed increased crime activity.  
- **Geospatial clustering** revealed recurring crime hotspots.  

---

## ðŸ“œ Future Enhancements  
- Integrate **deep learning models** to improve prediction accuracy.  
- Use **geospatial data** (e.g., neighborhood amenities) to refine crime predictions.  
- Add **real-time data updates** for continuous prediction refinement.
